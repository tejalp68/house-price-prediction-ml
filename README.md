🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning techniques.
The model analyzes various features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, and other property attributes to estimate the market price of a house.

The goal of this project is to build a reliable regression model that can help buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make data-driven decisions.

🎯 Problem Statement

In the real estate market, determining the accurate price of a property is challenging due to multiple influencing factors. Manual valuation methods are often inconsistent and subjective.

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts house prices based on historical housing data and relevant property features.
